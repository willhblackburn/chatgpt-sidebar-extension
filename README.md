# ChatGPT Sidebar Toggle

Toggle displaying the sidebar on ChatGPT.

A hamburger button (three lines) is displayed at the top left of the content section near the sidebar. Clicking this button will toggle hiding or displaying the sidebar.

You can also toggle the sidebar by clicking the plugin icon near the address bar.

Because the sidebar only automatically collapses at a small width, this will let you collapse the sidebar as you desire. This can be helpful when copying information back and forth from another window application, or using the chat as a reference.

Open-sourced on GitHub.
